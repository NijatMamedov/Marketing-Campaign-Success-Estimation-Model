# Marketing-Campaign-Success-Estimation-Model
Deployment 🚀
Using the final model, I generated income predictions for the income_deploy dataset.
Everything was already preprocessed the same way, so I just applied the trained model and got the results ready for use ✅
The model is now ready to be integrated wherever needed — whether it's for reporting, dashboards, or further analysis 📦
Modeling Steps ⚙️
I built the model in three versions:
1.	Default model – with standard parameters
2.	Importance-based model – trained using all features
3.	Optimized model – focused only on the most impactful variables
For each version, I evaluated performance using Gini, Precision, and Recall 📊
✅ In the optimized model, I only kept features with importance above 5% — keeping it clean, relevant, and effective.
Random Forest Classification with Feature Importance Selection 🌲
After training the initial Random Forest model, I analyzed feature importances to understand which variables were truly making an impact.
✅ I selected only those independent features that:
•	Had an importance score above 10%
•	Did not cause overfitting (i.e., had balanced train vs. test performance)
Then, I rebuilt the model using just these strong features — resulting in a more focused, efficient, and interpretable classifier ⚡
Hyperparameter Tuning Setup 🎯
To improve model performance, I used RandomizedSearchCV with a custom grid of hyperparameters:
•	🌲 n_estimators: Number of trees in the forest (200 to 1000)
•	🔍 max_features: How many features to consider at each split (sqrt, 0.3, 0.5, or all)
•	🏗️ max_depth: Tree depth (10 to 100)
•	✂️ min_samples_split: Min samples needed to split a node (20 or 50)
•	🍃 min_samples_leaf: Min samples at each leaf (5, 8, or 10)
This random grid helps explore different model configurations and find the most effective one without trying every possible combo 🔄
Univariate Analysis 🔍
Univariate analysis looks at each feature individually to see how well it explains the target variable.
It helps identify the most informative and stable predictors to include in the model ✅
Final Model 🧠
The final model was built using only the most impactful features, selected based on performance and stability.
This approach ensures a model that is both accurate and efficient, without unnecessary complexity ✅
Deployment 🚀
Using the final trained model, I calculated the probability of interest for each record in the test_data ✅
Only the features the model was trained on were used — ensuring consistency and reliable predictions 📊🔐
This step prepares the results for real-world use — whether it’s decision-making, reporting, or further action 🧩
